This is a task from MentorGraphics,

You are asked to design and implement a creative single page application for weather forecast with the following specifications:

The application consists of 2 displays 

Landing display : Showing a summary of the current weather for the user’s country (should detect user’s geographical location) 
		  Should be artistic and simple yet provide the most important information that a general user may need to know the weather of this country now.
	   	  Should provide access to the  different cities of the country, so the user can access display (2) 
City weather dashboard: 
		  Showing a summary of the current weather for the selected city in (1)
 		  Showing weather statistics and historical weather information for this city 
                  The design should include different types of data representations that match the nature of the data (Charts/tables/…)
 

It is required to deliver:
Design:
The application design showing  the full design idea (even if it will not be fully implemented)
You are free to choose any convenient way of prototyping (wireframes/sketches/…)
The design should include illustration for the user interaction with the application and a description for the different types of data visualization provided

Implementation Code:
The implemented application using Angular 2+ Or React
Use D3 for implementing at least one of the visualizations).
The implementation should conform to Angular 2+ Or React standards 
The implementation shall be responsive
(*optional: Add features for the user to interact with the dashboard gadgets layout (Expand/Collapse/Resize/Drag & Drop/…))
(*optional: Creating unit tests and e2e testing for the application)
Notes:
Using ready Angular/React dashboard templates will not be accepted
It's required to use native D3 implementation, avoid using D3 wrappers for angular/react

For the weather data, 

Please use this API: https://developer.worldweatheronline.com/ it gives a free PRO account for 30 days with a limit of 500 calls/day
You’re free to include dummy data on top of the sample data as you feel appropriate.
 

Please make sure you deploy your application. For example, you can deploy it on Heroku. You can check this video for a quick tutorial on how to do it How to deploy a React app to Heroku
